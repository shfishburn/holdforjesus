## The Split Brain

The site is built on a deliberate tonal duality: **satirical comedy** and **sincere data/resources** coexist in the same application, and both halves make the other stronger.

The navigation reflects this explicitly:

| Group | Label | Pages | Tone |
|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **The Hotline** | Satirical | Home, Pray, Community, History | Warm corporate-divine comedy |
| **The Real World** | Sincere | Global Pain Index, Crisis Help | No satire — real data, real help |

**Why it works:** The satire targets the absurdity of a chatbot handling spiritual questions — not faith itself, and not suffering. The sincere pages exist as moral counterweights: *"This is why we built a comedy hotline. Because sometimes the only honest response to numbers like these is to laugh — and then do something."*

**The Community page** occupies an intentional middle ground — it's framed as a sincere anonymous space ("not part of the satire") where users can share real reflections, light candles, and add voices to global causes.

**Context for direct visitors:** The Pain Index includes a small banner for users who arrive via search without seeing the hotline: *"This page is part of Hold for Jesus, a satirical AI prayer hotline. The data here is real. The hotline is not."*

## The Satirical Half — The Divine Hotline

### Concept

Prayer is reframed as a helpdesk ticket processed by "heavenly customer service." Each faith tradition gets a unique hotline, phone number, AI persona, departments, and closing prayer style.

### Six Faith Traditions

| Faith | Hotline Name | Phone | Voice Inspiration | Manager |
|-------|-------------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| Christianity | Hold for Jesus | 1-800-JESUS | C.S. Lewis — warm, literary, witty | Jesus (Employee of the Millennium) |
| Islam | Hold for Allah | 1-800-SALAM | Rumi — poetic mysticism + mercy | Jibril (Head of Angelic Communications) |
| Judaism | Hold for Hashem | 1-800-SHALOM | Jewish grandmother + Talmudic wit | Moses (Senior VP of Exodus Operations) |
| Hinduism | Hold for Brahman | 1-800-DHARMA | Bhagavad Gita teacher + cosmic warmth | Ganesha (Chief Obstacle Removal Officer) |
| Buddhism | Hold for Enlightenment | 1-800-SANGHA | Thich Nhat Hanh — gentle, present | Avalokiteshvara (Head of Compassion, 1000 arms) |
| Secular | Hold for Reason | 1-800-THINK | Carl Sagan — cosmic wonder + humanism | Carl Sagan's Ghost (Pale Blue Dot Division) |

### Departments Per Faith

Each tradition has 3-4 themed departments that lean into the corporate satire:

- **Christianity:** General, Old Testament Complaints, Saints & Angels Help Desk, Hard Questions Desk
- **Islam:** General, Fiqh Helpline, Sufi Poetry Desk, Whispers & Doubt Desk
- **Judaism:** General, Talmudic Debates, Bubbe's Advice Desk, Inner Struggle Desk
- **Hinduism:** General, Karma Accounting, Bhakti Devotion Desk, Darkness & Dharma Desk
- **Buddhism:** General, Zen Koans Desk, Metta Meditation Desk, Illusion & Clarity Desk
- **Secular:** General, Stoic Support, Existential Help Desk, Cognitive Clarity Desk

### Prayer Categories

Four optional categories modify the AI's response tone: **Gratitude**, **Guidance**, **Complaint**, **Emergency**.

### The User Flow

1. Choose faith tradition → sets persona, hotline branding, closing prayer style
2. Select department (optional) → adds sub-prompt layer
3. Pick category (optional) → further tunes response tone
4. Write prayer (max 500 characters)
5. Hold screen with procedural hold music (Web Audio API: Harps, Gospel, Gregorian)
6. Receive AI-generated response + closing prayer + shareable receipt card
7. Optionally save to local history (Zustand, no server storage)

## The Sincere Half — The Real World

### Global Pain Index (`/observatory`)

A real-time dashboard tracking global indicators of poverty, hunger, displacement, conflict, and mortality. **No satire.** Data from 8+ authoritative sources, refreshed every 6 hours.

Features:
- **Composite Pain Index** (0–100) with six interpretive bands: Low Distress → Catastrophic
- **Category groupings:** Conflict & Violence, Displacement & Exploitation, Health & Mortality, Poverty & Hunger, Natural Hazards, Humanitarian Response
- **Top drivers panel** showing the 3 indicators contributing most to the current score
- **Admissibility badges** classifying each data point: Authoritative, Signal, Derived
- **Category headline filters** on each card acting as interactive filter shortcuts
- **Full methodology transparency** including weights, score bands, and source links

### Crisis Resources (`/crisis`)

Paired "Get Help" and "Give Help" resources across 8 categories:
- Mental Health, LGBTQ+ Youth, Domestic Violence, Substance Abuse, Veterans, Human Rights, Hunger, Homelessness
- Emergency banner with 988/911 direct dial
- No tracking, no analytics on this page
- Cross-links to the Pain Index for broader context

### About Page (`/about`)

Explicitly frames the project's dual nature:
- "The Serious Side" section explains why the sincere pages exist
- Research Purpose section documents detection modes and failure modes
- Links to both Pain Index and Crisis Resources

## AI Workflow Architecture

### Edge Function: `pray`

The prayer system uses a **single edge function with a 6-section modular architecture:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Section 1: Rate Limiting                            │
│   IP-based sliding window (10 req/min)              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Section 2: Detection Patterns                       │
│   Regex catalog grouped by safety mode              │
│   Priority: crisis > troll > off_topic >            │
│     divine_attribution > scrupulosity > normal      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Section 3: Message Classifier                       │
│   Pure function: message → mode + metadata          │
│   Outputs: InteractionMode, detectedSignals[],      │
│            appliedGuardrails[]                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Section 4: Prompt Registry                          │
│   Declarative catalog — ALL prompt text lives here  │
│   4A: Structural fragments (crisis rule, core)      │
│   4B: Faith personas (6 traditions)                 │
│   4C: Department sub-prompts (18 departments)       │
│   4D: Category prompts (4 categories)               │
│   4E: Hotline metadata                              │
│   4F: Safety mode overrides                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Section 5: PromptBuilder                            │
│   Composable builder class — ALL logic, no content  │
│   Methods: base() → section() → when() →            │
│            interpolate() → build()                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Section 6: Request Handler                          │
│   6A: Validate (IP, message length, API key)        │
│   6B: Classify + build prompt                       │
│   6C: Call AI Gateway (Gemini 3 Flash)              │
│   6D: Post-process ([TROLL] prefix detection)       │
│   6E: Generate closing prayer (parallel)            │
│   6F: Log analytics + safety signals (fire-forget)  │
│   6G: Respond { reply, closingPrayer, mode }        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Prompt Composition

The `PromptBuilder` class strictly separates **content** (Section 4) from **logic** (Section 5). Prompts are composed like layers:

```
Faith Persona (always present)
  + Core Rules (crisis rule, tone guidelines)
    + Department sub-prompt (if selected)
      + Category prompt (if selected)
        + Safety override (if mode ≠ normal)
          + Troll self-classify instruction (if mode ≠ crisis)
```

This means a Christianity + Saints Desk + Guidance + Scrupulosity detection produces a completely different prompt than Islam + Sufi + Complaint + Normal — all from the same composable registry.

### Dual AI Calls

Each prayer request triggers up to **two AI calls in parallel:**

1. **Main response** — the agent persona responds to the prayer
2. **Closing prayer** — a separate prompt generates a faith-appropriate closing prayer/reflection

Closing prayers are skipped for crisis, troll, and off-topic modes.

### AI Gateway

AI calls use Google Gemini 3 Flash via Supabase Edge Functions. Rate limits (429) and upstream errors are caught and surfaced as themed error messages ("The lines are jammed").

## Safety & Moderation System

### Hybrid Detection: Regex + AI Self-Classification

The system uses a **two-layer detection strategy:**

**Layer 1 — Regex (instant):**
Pattern groups with strict priority ordering:

| Priority | Mode | Patterns | Example Triggers |
|----------|------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Crisis** | Self-harm, suicidal ideation, hopelessness | "want to die", "no reason to live" |
| 2 | **Troll** | Profanity, slurs, spam, gibberish, satanic trolling | "hail satan", "asdf", slurs |
| 3 | **Off-Topic** | Code requests, recipes, tech support, trivia | "write me python", "fix my car" |
| 4 | **Reality Anchor** | Divine attribution to the AI | "are you really God?", "this is a miracle" |
| 5 | **Scrupulosity** | Religious OCD, damnation anxiety | "unforgivable sin", "am I damned?" |
| 6 | **Normal** | Everything else | Genuine prayers |

**Layer 2 — AI Self-Classification (catches subtle cases):**
Normal-mode prompts include a `[TROLL]` self-classify instruction. If the AI detects subtle mockery or bad-faith intent that regex missed, it prefixes its response with `[TROLL]`. The handler strips the prefix and reclassifies the interaction — all in a single API call with zero added latency.

### Six Interaction Modes

Each mode triggers distinct behavior:

| Mode | Persona | UI Behavior | Closing Prayer |
|------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Normal** | Faith-specific agent | Full response + receipt card + share | ✅ Generated |
| **Crisis** | Drops all satire — sincere only | 988 lifeline + Crisis Text Line | ❌ Skipped |
| **Troll** | Switchboard Operator | Playful absorption, archived to joke dept | ❌ Skipped |
| **Off-Topic** | Switchboard Operator | Warm redirect to earthly services | ❌ Skipped |
| **Reality Anchor** | Fourth-wall break | "I'm an AI comedy app, not God" | ✅ Generated |
| **Scrupulosity** | Extra-gentle agent | No tough love, reassurance-first | ✅ Generated |

### Troll Handling: "Playful Absorption"

Instead of scolding or blocking trolls, the system **absorbs** their message into the hotline metaphor:

- The message is "routed" to a random department: *Divine Spam Filter*, *Celestial Noise Desk*, *Department of Crossed Wires*, etc.
- A calm Switchboard Operator acknowledges the "atmospheric interference" and archives it
- The door is left open: *"If something meaningful finds its way to the receiver, the switchboard is always open."*
- Sign-off is branded to the selected faith (e.g., "Switchboard Operator, Hold for Allah")

This deflates trolling without engaging, breaking character, or being preachy.

### Safety Signal Logging

Every interaction logs to `safety_signals`:
- `interaction_mode` — which of the 6 modes was triggered
- `detected_signals[]` — which pattern groups matched (can be multiple)
- `applied_guardrails[]` — which safety prompts were injected
- `consented` — whether the user accepted the disclaimer

This creates an auditable record of the moderation system's decisions without storing prayer text.

## Data Pipeline — Global Pain Index

### Edge Function: `suffering-index`

A serverless ETL pipeline with the architecture:

```
Source Adapters (11 active)
    ↓
raw_records (immutable audit trail)
    ↓
canonical_entities (normalized schema)
    ↓
normalization_registry (weights + baselines)
    ↓
derived_scores (composite index)
    ↓
suffering_index (cached final score)
```

### Source Adapters

Each adapter follows the same contract: `fetch → { raw, canonical }` with full provenance metadata.

| Source | Adapter | Entity Kind | Domain | Admissibility |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| World Bank (5 indicators) | `adapterWorldBank` | indicator_observation | development | Authoritative |
| UNHCR | `adapterUNHCR` | population_observation | displacement | Authoritative |
| Global Slavery Index | `adapterGSI` | indicator_observation | slavery | Authoritative |
| GDELT | `adapterGDELT` | event | conflict | Signal Only |
| UN SDG 16.1.1 | `adapterUNSDG` | indicator_observation | conflict | Authoritative |
| ACLED | `adapterACLED` | event | conflict | Authoritative (pending credentials) |
| WHO Neonatal | `adapterWHO` | indicator_observation | health | Authoritative |
| USGS Earthquakes | `adapterUSGS` | event | disaster | Authoritative |
| NASA FIRMS | `adapterFIRMS` | event | disaster | Authoritative |
| UN OCHA/HDX | `adapterHDX` | dataset_resource | humanitarian_catalog | Authoritative |

### Normalization

Scores are computed using a **registry-driven weighted model** stored in `normalization_registry`:

1. Each indicator has `baseline_min`, `baseline_max`, `direction` (higher_worse / lower_worse), and `weight`
2. Raw values are min-max normalized to 0–1
3. Direction-inverted indicators (e.g., life expectancy) are flipped: `1 - normalized`
4. The composite score is a weighted average × 100

### Data Quality

Every canonical entity carries:
- `admissibility_status`: authoritative | signal_only | derived | needs_review
- `admissibility_reasons[]`: provenance trail
- `quality`: source confidence, estimate/model/aggregate flags
- `lineage`: schema version, normalizer version, transform notes

### Refresh Cycle

A `pg_cron` job triggers the edge function every 6 hours via `pg_net`. Results are cached in `suffering_index` and `suffering_metrics` for instant page loads.

---

## Privacy Architecture

- **No accounts required** — the entire app works without authentication
- **Prayer text is never stored on the server** — responses are generated, returned, and discarded
- **Local-only persistence** — prayer history, favorites, and preferences use Zustand stores backed by `localStorage`
- **Prayer Wall entries are ephemeral** — designed to fade after 24 hours
- **Global activity indicators** (live feed, volume indicator) use only broad city/region labels
- **Crisis page has zero analytics** — no tracking scripts on that page
- **Safety signals log mode + metadata only** — never the prayer content itself
